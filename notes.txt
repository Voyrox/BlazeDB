Cloud interface options:

- Do a proxy that manges the request
    - Cross refernces user with the database if they created that keyspace
    - If they did, then it forwards the request to the database
    - If they did not, then it returns an error message

- On the database side
    - Have a level 0 database that stores the keyspace and the user that created it
    - When a request comes in, it checks the level 0 database to see if the user is authorized to access the keyspace
    - If they are, it forwards the request to the appropriate keyspace
    - If they are not, it returns an error message
    - Level 0, Level 1, Level 0 can r/w to core database, but level 1 can only r/w to the keyspace it created
